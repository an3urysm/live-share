# Quickstart: Join your first collaboration session

Welcome to Visual Studio Live Share! Live Share lets you to achieve greater confidence at speed by streamlining collaborative editing, debugging, and more in real-time during development.

Just follow these steps to join a collaboration session.

### 1. Install the extension

Installing the extension is easy. Just follow these steps:

<table style="width: 100%; border-style: none;">
<tr style="border:none;">
    <td style="width: 128px; text-align: center; border:none;"><img src="media/vs-icon.png" /></td>
    <td style="border:none;">

       3. Download and install the VS Live Share extension from the marketplace. <br />

By downloading and using Visual Studio Live Share, you agree to the [license terms](https://aka.ms/vsls-license) and [privacy statement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/EnterpriseDev/default.aspx). See [troubleshooting](https://aka.ms/vsls-troubleshooting) if you run into problems.

### 2. Start a discussion with the host

It's always good to start up a conversation via voice or chat in your favorite client before joining a collaboration session since you'll obviously need to communicate to collaborate.

### 3. Open/re-open the invite link in a browser

After installing Visual Studio Live Share for your IDE/editor, simply open (or re-open) the invite web page using the invite link your colleague sent you.

You should be notified that your browser wants to launching your Visual Studio Live Share enabled tool and if you accept it the IDE/editor will launch and automatically start the process of joining the collaboration session.


> **Troubleshooting Tip:** When using VS Code, be sure you've **started the tool at least once** after installing Visual Studio Live Share before opening/re-opening the invite page. Still having trouble? See [join manually](collab-session.md#join-manually) for details.

### 4. Sign into Live Share

To let other collaborators know who you are, you may be asked to sign in during the join process using a GitHub or Microsoft work, school, or personal account.

If you are using Visual Studio and have already signed into the tool, Visual Studio Live Share will automatically use your [personalization account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/signing-in-to-visual-studio) so you can skip this step! If prefer to use a different sign-in than your VS personalization account, go to **Tools &gt; Options &gt; Live Share &gt; User account** to switch credentials.

### 5. Collaborate!

That's it!! In a few moments you'll be connected to your colleague's collaboration session.
