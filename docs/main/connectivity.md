# Connectivity requirements for Live Share

To ensure optimal performance, by default Visual Studio Live Share automatically detects whether a collaboration session host machine and guest machine can communicate directly over a network and only relays via the cloud if there is no route between them. This mixed "auto" mode is flexible and even allows some guests to relay through the cloud while others connect directly for the same session.

The direct connections are authenticated via a cloud based mechanism to ensure security but require a port between 5990 and 5999 be opened to enable the connectivity. As a result, when sharing for the first time your desktop firewall may prompt you open a port. Accepting this is optional as ignoring it will simply cause Live Share to always use the relay when in auto mode.

All connections in Visual Studio Live Share are SSH or SSL encrypted and authenticated against a central service to ensure that only those in the collaboration session can gain access to its content. In addition, Live Share's internet relay does not persist any traffic routed through it and does not "snoop" the traffic in any way.

## Changing the connection mode

If you would prefer to disable direct or relayed connections or are simply troubleshooting connectivity problems, you can force other connection modes.

| Mode | Host Behavior | Guest Behavior |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| Auto | The host's collaboration session accepts secured, authenticated direct connections or cloud relayed connections. | Attempts to use a direct connection and falls back to relaying through the cloud if this fails. |
| Direct | The host's collaboration session only accepts authenticated, secure direct connections. | Attempts to use a direct connection and stops if it cannot connect. |
| Relay | The host's collaboration session does not allow direct connections. No port is opened on the host's machine. | Always connects via the cloud. |

To change the mode:

- **VS:** Go to Tools > Options > Live Share, select the mode from the "Connection Mode" dropdown and then restart VS.
- **VS Code:** Edit settings.json (File > Preferences > Settings) and add one of the following and then restart VS Code:
  - ``"liveshare.connectionMode":"auto"``
  - ``"liveshare.connectionMode":"direct"``
  - ``"liveshare.connectionMode":"relay"``

## Requirements for connection modes

The specific ports and URLs that need to be available for Live Share to function will vary depending on the connection mode you are in.

| Mode | Requirements | Troubleshooting |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| All | Access to *.liveshare.vsengsaas.visualstudio.com on port 80/443 | Ensure your corporate or personal network firewall allows you to connect to this domain. Enter https://insiders.liveshare.vsengsaas.visualstudio.com in a browser and verify you land at the VS Live Share home page. |
| All (VS Code) | Access to download.visualstudio.microsoft.com and download.microsoft.com on port 443 | Ensure your corporate or personal network firewall allows you to connect to this domain. |
| Auto | Auto-switches. See direct and relay modes. | Switch to direct or relay mode to troubleshoot. |
| Direct | A port in the range 5990 - 5999 needs to be open on the host's machine and guests need to be able to directly connect to each other. (See [this feature request](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/live-share/issues/60) for a proposed improvement.) | Verify "vsls-agent" is not blocked by your desktop firewall software for this port range and that you can ping one another. While Windows and other desktop software should prompt you the first time the agent starts up, we have seen instances where group policies prevent this from happening and you will need to [manually add the entry](#manually-adding-a-firewall-entry). |
| Relay | Access to *.servicebus.windows.net on port 80/443. | Ensure your corporate or personal network firewall allows you to connect to this domain. |

## Manually adding a firewall entry

As outlined above, your personal firewall needs to allow **vsls-agent**to accept connections in the port range 5990-5999. If you want to use direct mode but have found that your firewall does not have vsls-agent entry, you can add it from one of the following locations:

VS Code (substitute **VERSION** for the extension version):

- **Windows:** %USERPROFILE%\\.vscode\extensions\ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-*VERSION*\dotnet_modules\win7-x86\vsls-agent.exe
- **macOS:** $HOME/.vscode/extensions/ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-*VERSION*/dotnet_modules/osx.10.10-x64/vsls-agent

Visual Studio:
- Run a search for vsls-agent.exe in your VS install location under **IDE\Extensions**
- The VS install location is typically C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Preview\\*EDITION* where **EDITION** is Community, Enterprise, etc
